/* What is a variable?  Variables are named containers for storing data values. 
  We name the variables so that we can refer to this data again.

/*(1)  (2)    (3)    (4)     

1- Keyword
2- Variable name 
3- Assignment Operator
4- Variable value
*/

/*notes on variables:
//1)  A variable name must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
//2)  Numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
//3)  JavaScript is case sensitive-- 'hello' and 'HeLlo' are different variables
//4)  variables must be identified with unique names
//5)  No spaces are allowed in variable names
//6)  camelCase is the best practice for naming variables. 
This is good practice because it helps keep variables readable--  var myName = 'Autumn';

/*
Declarations are the LEFT SIDE of a variable
  It is simply the var x
  It is on the left side of the assignment operator (=)

Initializations are the RIGHT SIDE of a variable
  It sets the value of the variable
  It incorporates the variable name (x), the assignment operator (=), and the value (10) => x = 10
  (=) assignment operator is NOT the same as the equal operator (== or ===)
